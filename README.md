# SummerStudent_Tracking_2024

1. NeuralNetworksTutorial.ipynb - a brief tutorial with examples about neural networks and graph neural networks.
2. GNN_Tutorial.ipynb - an example of GNN pattern recognition (track finding) in 2D.
3. GNN_Tutorial_PID.ipynb - the same, but with particle identifiction: three classes of edges (none, positive track, negative track) are classified.
3. GNN_Tutorial_PID_LogSoftmax.ipynb - the same, but with the LogSoftmax activation function.
